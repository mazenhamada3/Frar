# FRAR

## Project Description
FRAR is a C++ application designed to efficiently compress and decompress text files using the Huffman Tree algorithm. This project explores file compression techniques and their implementation in C++.

## Features
- **Compression**: Compress text files with high efficiency that could reach 52% using the Huffman Tree algorithm.
- **Decompression**: Decompress previously compressed files back to their original text format.

## How to Use
### Running the Application
1. **Launch the Application**: Open the project and run the executable or run through visual studio.

2. **Choose an Operation**:
    - **Compress a File**: Press `c`
    - **Decompress a File**: Press `d`

### Compression
1. When prompted, press `c` to select the compression option.
2. The file should be at the same path as the project.
3. Enter the filename with its `.txt` extension that you wish to compress.
4. The application will compress the specified file and save the compressed version.

### Decompression
1. When prompted, press `d` to select the decompression option.
2. Enter the filename with its `.com` extension that you wish to decompress.
3. The application will decompress the specified file back to its original text format.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```sh
